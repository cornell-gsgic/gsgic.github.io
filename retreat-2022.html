  <div class="section">
    <p>There is no need to prepare anything going into the retreat, though you may want to think about the types of projects youâ€™d be interested to work on. Please bring laptops.  As a reminder, this will be a hybrid event with participants on Zoom and in-person. All members of the graduate community at Cornell are welcome. Everyone is welcome to drop in and out of the retreat as they wish.</p>
    <p>Thank you to the <a href="https://diversity.cis.cornell.edu/">Cornell Bowers CIS Office of DEI</a> for sponsoring our retreat this year.</p>
